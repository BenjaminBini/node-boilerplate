# Node.js boilerplate

This is a very simple boilerplate for my projects using node.js

## Babel

The project use Babel with "latest" preset.

## Back-end

The back-end uses express to start a web server.

## Front-end

The front-end part is on the todo list. It will use Vue.js and certainly gulp.

## ESLint

The code is linted with ESLint using airbnb preset plus some custom rules.

## Commands

* npm start
  * Start the server with babel-node (for development only)
* npm watch
  * Start the server and watch for any change in the "server" directory to restart it using nodemon
* npm build
  * Build the back-end sources with babel
* npm serve
  * Run the build sources with node
